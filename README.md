# pforcs-problem-sheet
Programming for Cybersecurity repository (GMIT)

Notes:

* Contained within the main.py file of this repository are functions aiming to solve the problems outlined in the following attached problem_sheet.txt file

* Each function can be conveniently tested by running main.py, located in the root directory of this repository.
* Within this file, the following format can be observed:

    - \# Week \<Week No\>
    - \#\<Function for that week\>

* Simply uncomment the line for the function and run main.py locally
* Wherever information from external pages were used, links to these resources are shown in the following format

    - \# Reference:   \<Link to the resource\>

* Methods declared are preceded with the following

    - \# Method:   \<The name of the method\>
    - \# Description:   \<A brief description of what the method does\>

* For most main methods (i.e those located in the directories prefixed by 'week%'), much of the logic is handled by a set of methods located 
in the file 'helpers.py', within the root directory.
* Unit tests for these helper methods are contained within the file 'test_helper_methods.py', also located within the root directory.
